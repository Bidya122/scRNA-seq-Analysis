# scRNA-seq-Analysis
Downstream single-cell RNA-seq analysis starting from an RDS Seurat object, performing dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cell-type marker discovery.
# Dataset: GSE183276, 49 samples   [Click to view Dataset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183276)
Single Cell RNA-Seq performed on kidney tissues from 15 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), 12 Acute Kidney Disease (AKI) and 20 healthy reference (Ref) individuals.  
Tools Used: RStudio, Python
*Introduction of Dataset:* ##A subset of**49 scRNA-seq samples** was analyzed from a larger kidney atlas study.
- Data type: Single-cell RNA sequencing    
- Samples: Healthy donors and kidney disease patients    
- Scale: High-dimensional gene expression data across thousands of cells    

This dataset enables:    
- Identification of cell types via clustering    
- Detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)    
- Characterization of disease-associated cellular states

I begin by loading the .rds file, which stores the single-cell dataset (typically a Seurat object) including expression matrices and prior preprocessing steps.
Alongside this, I import the metadata file containing cell-wise annotations (e.g., sample origin, condition labels, batch information), which is essential for downstream grouping, visualization, and biological interpretation.
The code to do so on Linux is given here but could be also done on R in the command platform. 
```bash
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE183nnn/GSE183276/suppl/GSE183276_Kidney_Healthy-Injury_Cell_Atlas_scCv3_Counts_03282022.RDS.gz

Seurat is a tool that helps us organize and understand data from thousands of individual cells. It takes raw gene activity data and turns it into something we can explore — like grouping similar cells, finding different cell types, and visualizing patterns. The .rds file is used to store a Seurat object, which encapsulates the entire single-cell RNA-seq dataset in a structured format. It typically contains raw or normalized gene expression data, cell metadata, feature annotations, and results from prior analyses such as PCA, clustering, and UMAP. This allows the dataset to be easily reloaded without repeating computationally intensive preprocessing steps.    
# For further steps, I have provided the R code here in chunks. The chunks are self explanatory with the use of comments.
